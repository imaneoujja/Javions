Javions is a Java application developed in the scope of the CS108 course at EPFL : https://cs108.epfl.ch/archive/23/archive.html

# Javions

## Project Overview

**Javions** is a Java application developed to facilitate air traffic control by decoding Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) messages from aircraft and other aerial vehicles. These messages contain crucial information such as the aircraft's identity, position, speed, and direction.

The application utilizes the **AirSpy R2** Software-Defined Radio (SDR) to capture ADS-B messages broadcasted at 1090 MHz. The decoded messages are visualized on an interactive map, allowing for real-time tracking of aircraft in the vicinity.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor the positions of nearby aircraft in real time.
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly graphical interface for easy navigation and operation.
- **Signal Reception**: Utilizes SDR technology to capture and decode ADS-B messages.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays aircraft positions on a map, providing essential flight data.

Javions aims to enhance the monitoring and management of air traffic, offering insights into the dynamic nature of aviation logistics.
